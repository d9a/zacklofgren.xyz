===============

This is the source, templates, etc. for my personal website.

It was generated with saait by Hiltjo Posthuma, which is the only
dependency to generate more web pages if you want to use the templates
and not do it by hand.
https://codemadness.org/git/saait/file/README.html

pages/ and templates/ are used by saait to generate blog/ to be pushed to
https://blog.zacklofgren.xyz.

root/ is the homepage and everything else that should be at
https://www.zacklofgren.xyz.

`make generate` will generate the site with saait.
`make sync` will use rsync to push blog/ and root/ to my domains.
You must change this to your server for it to work.
